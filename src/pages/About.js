          I currently manage a team of Account Managers at a video tech company
          and I'm studying to become a front-end developer. <br /><br />
          I have created a handful of useful websites that you can check out
         by clicking "My Work". Click the images to check out the live sites.

          I love playing tennis and reading history books. Feel free to get in touch!
